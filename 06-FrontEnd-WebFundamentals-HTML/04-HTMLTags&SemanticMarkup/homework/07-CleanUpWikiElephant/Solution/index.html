	<p>Large terrestrial mammals with trunks from Africa and Asia</p>
	<p><b>Elephants</b> are large mammals of the family <a href="/wiki/Elephantidae">Elephantidae</a> in the order <a href="/wiki/Proboscidea">Proboscidea</a>. Three species are currently recognised: the <a href="/wiki/African_bush_elephant">African bush elephant</a> (<i>Loxodonta africana</i>), the <a href="/wiki/African_forest_elephant">African forest elephant</a> (<i>L. cyclotis</i>), and the <a href="/wiki/Asian_elephant">Asian elephant</a> (<i>Elephas maximus</i>). Elephants are scattered throughout <a href="/wiki/Sub-Saharan_Africa">sub-Saharan Africa</a>, <a href="/wiki/South_Asia">South Asia</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Southeast_Asia">Southeast Asia</a>. Elephantidae is the only surviving family of the order Proboscidea; other, now extinct, members of the order include <a href="/wiki/Deinotheriidae">deinotheres</a>, <a href="/wiki/Gomphothere">gomphotheres</a>, <a href="/wiki/Mammutidae">mastodons</a>, <a href="/wiki/Anancidae">anancids</a> and <a href="/wiki/Stegodontidae">stegodontids</a>; Elephantidae itself also contains several now extinct groups, such as the <a href="/wiki/Mammoth">mammoths</a> and <a href="/wiki/Palaeoloxodon">straight-tusked elephants</a>.</p>
	<p>All elephants have several distinctive features, the most notable of which is a long trunk (also called a <a href="/wiki/Proboscis">proboscis</a>), used for many purposes, particularly breathing, lifting water, and grasping objects. Their <a href="/wiki/Incisor">incisors</a> grow into tusks, which can serve as weapons and as tools for moving objects and digging. Elephants' large ear flaps help to control their body temperature. Their <a href="/wiki/Column">pillar</a>-like legs can carry their great weight. African elephants have larger ears and concave backs while Asian elephants have smaller ears and convex or level backs.</p>
	<p>Elephants are herbivorous and can be found in different habitats including <a href="/wiki/Savanna">savannahs</a>, forests, deserts, and <a href="/wiki/Marsh">marshes</a>. They prefer to stay near water. They are considered to be a <a href="/wiki/Keystone_species">keystone species</a> due to their impact on their environments. Other animals tend to keep their distance from elephants while predators, such as <a href="/wiki/Lion">lions</a>, <a href="/wiki/Tiger">tigers</a>, <a href="/wiki/Hyena">hyenas</a>, and any <a href="/wiki/Canidae">wild dogs</a>, usually target only young elephants (or "calves"). Elephants have a <a href="/wiki/Fission%E2%80%93fusion_society">fission–fusion society</a> in which multiple family groups come together to socialise. Females ("cows") tend to live in family groups, which can consist of one female with her calves or several related females with offspring. The groups are led by an individual known as the <a href="/wiki/Matriarchy">matriarch</a>, often the oldest cow.</p>
	<p>Males ("bulls") leave their family groups when they reach puberty and may live alone or with other males. Adult bulls mostly interact with family groups when looking for a mate and enter a state of increased <a href="/wiki/Testosterone">testosterone</a> and aggression known as <a href="/wiki/Musth">musth</a>, which helps them gain <a href="/wiki/Dominance_(ethology)">dominance</a> and reproductive success. Calves are the centre of attention in their family groups and rely on their mothers for as long as three years. Elephants can live up to 70 years in the wild. They communicate by touch, sight, smell, and sound; elephants use <a href="/wiki/Infrasound">infrasound</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Seismic_communication">seismic communication</a> over long distances. <a href="/wiki/Elephant_cognition">Elephant intelligence</a> has been compared with that of <a href="/wiki/Primate">primates</a> and <a href="/wiki/Cetacea">cetaceans</a>. They appear to have <a href="/wiki/Self-awareness">self-awareness</a> and show <a href="/wiki/Empathy">empathy</a> for dying or dead individuals of their kind.</p>
	<p>African elephants are listed as <a href="/wiki/Vulnerable_species">vulnerable</a> by the <a href="/wiki/International_Union_for_Conservation_of_Nature">International Union for Conservation of Nature</a> (IUCN) while the Asian elephant is classed as <a href="/wiki/Endangered_species">endangered</a>. One of the biggest threats to elephant populations is the <a href="/wiki/Ivory_trade">ivory trade</a>, as the animals are <a href="/wiki/Poaching">poached</a> for their ivory tusks. Other threats to wild elephants include <a href="/wiki/Habitat_destruction">habitat destruction</a> and conflicts with local people. Elephants are used as <a href="/wiki/Working_animal">working animals</a> in Asia. In the past, they were used in war; today, they are often controversially put on display in zoos, or exploited for entertainment in <a href="/wiki/Circus">circuses</a>. Elephants are highly recognisable and have been featured in art, folklore, religion, literature, and <a href="/wiki/Popular_culture">popular culture</a>.</p>

	<h2>Etymology</h2>
	<p>The word "elephant" is based on the <a href="/wiki/Latin">Latin</a> <i>elephas</i> (<a href="/wiki/Genitive">genitive</a> <i>elephantis</i>) ("elephant"), which is the <a href="/wiki/Latinisation_of_names">Latinised</a> form of the <a href="/wiki/Greek_language">Greek</a> ἐλέφας (<i>elephas</i>) (genitive ἐλέφαντος (<i>elephantos</i>)),<a href="#cite_note-LSJ-1">&#91;1&#93;</a> probably from a non-<a href="/wiki/Indo-European_languages">Indo-European</a> language, likely <a href="/wiki/Phoenician_language">Phoenician</a>.<a href="#cite_note-etymology-2">&#91;2&#93;</a> It is attested in <a href="/wiki/Mycenaean_Greek">Mycenaean Greek</a> as <i>e-re-pa</i> (genitive <i>e-re-pa-to</i>) in <a href="/wiki/Linear_B">Linear B</a> syllabic script.<a href="#cite_note-3">&#91;3&#93;</a><a href="#cite_note-4">&#91;4&#93;</a> As in Mycenaean Greek, <a href="/wiki/Homer">Homer</a> used the Greek word to mean <a href="/wiki/Ivory">ivory</a>, but after the time of <a href="/wiki/Herodotus">Herodotus</a>, it also referred to the animal.<a href="#cite_note-LSJ-1">&#91;1&#93;</a> The word "elephant" appears in <a href="/wiki/Middle_English">Middle English</a> as <i>olyfaunt</i> (c.1300) and was borrowed from <a href="/wiki/Old_French">Old French</a> <i>oliphant</i> (12th century).<a href="#cite_note-etymology-2">&#91;2&#93;</a> <i><a href="/wiki/African_elephant">Loxodonta</a></i>, the generic name for the African elephants, is Greek for "oblique-sided tooth".<a href="#cite_note-5">&#91;5&#93;</a></p>

	<p>The <a href="/wiki/African_elephant">African elephant</a> was first named by German naturalist <a href="/wiki/Johann_Friedrich_Blumenbach">Johann Friedrich Blumenbach</a> in 1797 as <i>Elephas africanus</i>.<a href="#cite_note-17">&#91;17&#93;</a> The genus <i>Loxodonta</i> was named by <a href="/wiki/Fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric_Cuvier">Frédéric Cuvier</a> in 1825.<a href="#cite_note-18">&#91;18&#93;</a> Cuvier spelled it <i>Loxodonte,</i> but in 1827 an anonymous author <a href="/wiki/Romanization">romanised</a> the spelling to <i>Loxodonta<a href="#cite_note-19">&#91;19&#93;</a></i>; the <a href="/wiki/International_Code_of_Zoological_Nomenclature">International Code of Zoological Nomenclature</a> recognises this as the proper authority.<a href="#cite_note-MSW3-9">&#91;9&#93;</a> In 1942, 18 subspecies of African elephant were recognised by <a href="/wiki/Henry_Fairfield_Osborn">Henry Fairfield Osborn</a>,<a href="#cite_note-20">&#91;20&#93;</a> but further morphological data has reduced the number of classified subspecies, and by the 1990s, only two were recognised, the savannah or bush elephant (<i>L.&#160;a.&#160;africana</i>) and the forest elephant (<i>L.&#160;a.&#160;cyclotis</i>),<a href="#cite_note-21">&#91;21&#93;</a> the latter having been named in 1900 by German zoologist <a href="/wiki/Paul_Matschie">Paul Matschie</a>.<a href="#cite_note-22">&#91;22&#93;</a> Forest elephants have smaller and more rounded ears and thinner and straighter tusks than bush elephants, and are limited in range to the forested areas of <a href="/wiki/West_Africa">western</a> and <a href="/wiki/Central_Africa">Central Africa</a>.<a href="#cite_note-Shoshani42-23">&#91;23&#93;</a> A 2000 study argued for the elevation of the two forms into separate species (<i>L.&#160;africana</i> and <i>L.&#160;cyclotis</i> respectively) based on differences in skull morphology.<a href="#cite_note-24">&#91;24&#93;</a> DNA studies published in 2001 and 2007 also suggested they were distinct species<a href="#cite_note-outgroup-25">&#91;25&#93;</a><a href="#cite_note-26">&#91;26&#93;</a> while studies in 2002 and 2005 concluded that they were the same species.<a href="#cite_note-27">&#91;27&#93;</a><a href="#cite_note-Debruyne-28">&#91;28&#93;</a> Further studies (2010, 2011, 2015) have supported African savannah and forest elephants' status as separate species.<a href="#cite_note-DNA-29">&#91;29&#93;</a><a href="#cite_note-Ishida-30">&#91;30&#93;</a><a href="#cite_note-genomic-31">&#91;31&#93;</a> The two species are believed to have diverged 6 million years ago<a href="#cite_note-32">&#91;32&#93;</a> and have been completely genetically isolated for the past 500,000 years.<a href="#cite_note-Palkopoulou-33">&#91;33&#93;</a> In 2017, DNA sequence analysis showed that <i>L. cyclotis</i> is more closely related to the extinct <i><a href="/wiki/Palaeoloxodon_antiquus">Palaeoloxodon antiquus</a></i>, than it is to <i>L. africana,</i> possibly undermining the genus Loxodonta as a whole.<a href="#cite_note-34">&#91;34&#93;</a> Some evidence suggests that elephants of western Africa are a separate species,<a href="#cite_note-35">&#91;35&#93;</a> although this is disputed.<a href="#cite_note-Debruyne-28">&#91;28&#93;</a><a href="#cite_note-Ishida-30">&#91;30&#93;</a> The <a href="/wiki/Pygmy_elephant">pygmy elephants</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Congo_Basin">Congo Basin</a>, which have been suggested to be a separate species (<i>Loxodonta pumilio</i>) are probably forest elephants whose small size and/or early maturity are due to environmental conditions.<a href="#cite_note-36">&#91;36&#93;</a></p>

	<p>Over 185 extinct members and three major <a href="/wiki/Adaptive_radiation">evolutionary radiations</a> of the order Proboscidea have been recorded.<a href="#cite_note-37">&#91;37&#93;</a> The earliest proboscids, the African <i><a href="/wiki/Eritherium">Eritherium</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Phosphatherium">Phosphatherium</a></i> of the late <a href="/wiki/Paleocene">Paleocene</a>, heralded the first radiation.<a href="#cite_note-Gheerbrant-38">&#91;38&#93;</a> The <a href="/wiki/Eocene">Eocene</a> included <i><a href="/wiki/Numidotherium">Numidotherium</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Moeritherium">Moeritherium</a>,</i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Barytherium">Barytherium</a></i> from Africa. These animals were relatively small and aquatic. Later on, genera such as <i><a href="/wiki/Phiomia">Phiomia</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Palaeomastodon">Palaeomastodon</a></i> arose; the latter likely inhabited forests and open woodlands. Proboscidean diversity declined during the Oligocene.<a href="#cite_note-39">&#91;39&#93;</a> One notable species of this epoch was <i><a href="/wiki/Eritreum">Eritreum</a> melakeghebrekristosi</i> of the <a href="/wiki/Horn_of_Africa">Horn of Africa</a>, which may have been an ancestor to several later species.<a href="#cite_note-link-40">&#91;40&#93;</a> The beginning of the <a href="/wiki/Miocene">Miocene</a> saw the second diversification, with the appearance of the <a href="/wiki/Deinotheriidae">deinotheres</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Mammutidae">mammutids</a>. The former were related to <i>Barytherium</i> and lived in Africa and Eurasia,<a href="#cite_note-Sukumar17-41">&#91;41&#93;</a> while the latter may have descended from <i>Eritreum</i><a href="#cite_note-link-40">&#91;40&#93;</a> and spread to North America.<a href="#cite_note-Sukumar17-41">&#91;41&#93;</a></p>
	<p>The second radiation was represented by the emergence of the <a href="/wiki/Gomphothere">gomphotheres</a> in the Miocene,<a href="#cite_note-Sukumar17-41">&#91;41&#93;</a> which likely evolved from <i>Eritreum</i><a href="#cite_note-link-40">&#91;40&#93;</a> and originated in Africa, spreading to every continent except Australia and Antarctica. Members of this group included <i><a href="/wiki/Gomphotherium">Gomphotherium</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Platybelodon">Platybelodon</a></i>.<a href="#cite_note-Sukumar17-41">&#91;41&#93;</a> The third radiation started in the late Miocene and led to the arrival of the elephantids, which descended from, and slowly replaced, the gomphotheres.<a href="#cite_note-42">&#91;42&#93;</a> The African <i><a href="/wiki/Primelephas">Primelephas</a> gomphotheroides</i> gave rise to <i>Loxodonta</i>, <i>Mammuthus,</i> and <i>Elephas</i>. <i>Loxodonta</i> branched off earliest around the Miocene and <a href="/wiki/Pliocene">Pliocene</a> boundary while <i>Mammuthus</i> and <i>Elephas</i> diverged later during the early Pliocene. <i>Loxodonta</i> remained in Africa while <i>Mammuthus</i> and <i>Elephas</i> spread to Eurasia, and the former reached North America. At the same time, the <a href="/wiki/Stegodontidae">stegodontids</a>, another proboscidean group descended from gomphotheres, spread throughout Asia, including the Indian subcontinent, China, southeast Asia, and Japan. Mammutids continued to evolve into new species, such as the <a href="/wiki/Mastodon">American mastodon</a>.<a href="#cite_note-43">&#91;43&#93;</a></p>
	<p>At the beginning of the <a href="/wiki/Pleistocene">Pleistocene</a>, elephantids experienced a high rate of <a href="/wiki/Speciation">speciation</a>.<a href="#cite_note-Sukmar44-45">&#91;45&#93;</a> The Pleistocene also saw the arrival of <i><a href="/wiki/Palaeoloxodon_namadicus">Palaeoloxodon namadicus</a></i>, the largest terrestrial mammal of all time.<a href="#cite_note-Larramendi,_A._2015-46">&#91;46&#93;</a> <i><a href="/wiki/Loxodonta_atlantica">Loxodonta atlantica</a></i> became the most common species in northern and southern Africa but was replaced by <i>Elephas iolensis</i> later in the Pleistocene. Only when <i>Elephas</i> disappeared from Africa did <i>Loxodonta</i> become dominant once again, this time in the form of the modern species. <i>Elephas</i> diversified into new species in Asia, such as <i>E.&#160;hysudricus</i> and <i>E.&#160;platycephus</i>;<a href="#cite_note-Sukumar28-47">&#91;47&#93;</a> the latter the likely ancestor of the modern Asian elephant.<a href="#cite_note-Sukmar44-45">&#91;45&#93;</a> <i>Mammuthus</i> evolved into several species, including the well-known <a href="/wiki/Woolly_mammoth">woolly mammoth</a>.<a href="#cite_note-Sukumar28-47">&#91;47&#93;</a> Interbreeding appears to have been common among elephantid species, which in some cases led to species with three ancestral genetic components, such as the straight-tusked elephants.<a href="#cite_note-Palkopoulou-33">&#91;33&#93;</a> In the <a href="/wiki/Late_Pleistocene">Late Pleistocene</a>, most proboscidean species vanished during the <a href="/wiki/Quaternary_glaciation">Quaternary glaciation</a> which <a href="/wiki/Quaternary_extinction_event">killed off</a> 50% of genera weighing over 5&#160;kg (11&#160;lb) worldwide.<a href="#cite_note-48">&#91;48&#93;</a></p>
	<p>Proboscideans experienced several evolutionary trends, such as an increase in size, which led to many giant species that stood up to 5&#160;m (16&#160;ft) tall.<a href="#cite_note-Larramendi,_A._2015-46">&#91;46&#93;</a> As with other <a href="/wiki/Megaherbivore">megaherbivores</a>, including the extinct <a href="/wiki/Sauropoda">sauropod</a> <a href="/wiki/Dinosaur">dinosaurs</a>, the large size of elephants likely developed to allow them to survive on vegetation with low nutritional value.<a href="#cite_note-49">&#91;49&#93;</a> Their limbs grew longer and the feet shorter and broader.<a href="#cite_note-evolution-44">&#91;44&#93;</a> The feet were originally <a href="/wiki/Plantigrade">plantigrade</a> and developed into a <a href="/wiki/Digitigrade">digitigrade</a> stance with cushion pads and the <a href="/wiki/Sesamoid_bone">sesamoid bone</a> providing support.<a href="#cite_note-50">&#91;50&#93;</a> Early proboscideans developed longer <a href="/wiki/Mandible">mandibles</a> and smaller <a href="/wiki/Skull">craniums</a> while more <a href="/wiki/Synapomorphy">derived</a> ones developed shorter mandibles, which shifted the head's <a href="/wiki/Center_of_mass">centre of gravity</a>. The skull grew larger, especially the cranium, while the neck shortened to provide better support for the skull. The increase in size led to the development and elongation of the mobile trunk to provide reach. The number of <a href="/wiki/Premolar">premolars</a>, incisors and <a href="/wiki/Canine_tooth">canines</a> decreased.<a href="#cite_note-evolution-44">&#91;44&#93;</a> The cheek teeth (molars and premolars) became larger and more specialized, especially after elephants started to switch from <a href="/wiki/C3_carbon_fixation">C3-plants</a> to <a href="/wiki/C4_carbon_fixation">C4-grasses</a>, which caused their teeth to undergo a three-fold increase in teeth height as well as substantial multiplication of lamellae after about five million years ago. Only in the last million years or so did they return to a diet mainly consisting of C3 trees and shrubs.<a href="#cite_note-51">&#91;51&#93;</a><a href="#cite_note-52">&#91;52&#93;</a> The upper second incisors grew into tusks, which varied in shape from straight, to curved (either upward or downward), to spiralled, depending on the species.

	<p>Several species of proboscideans lived on islands and experienced <a href="/wiki/Insular_dwarfism">insular dwarfism</a>. This occurred primarily during the Pleistocene when some elephant populations became isolated by fluctuating sea levels, although dwarf elephants did exist earlier in the Pliocene. These elephants likely grew smaller on islands due to a lack of large or viable predator populations and limited resources. By contrast, small mammals such as rodents develop <a href="/wiki/Island_gigantism">gigantism</a> in these conditions. Dwarf proboscideans are known to have lived in <a href="/wiki/Indonesia">Indonesia</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Channel_Islands_of_California">Channel Islands of California</a>, and several islands of the <a href="/wiki/Mediterranean_Sea">Mediterranean</a>.<a href="#cite_note-Sukumar31-59">&#91;59&#93;</a></p>

	<h2>Anatomy and morphology</h2>
	<a href="/wiki/File:Elephant_skeleton.jpg"></a>  <a href="/wiki/File:Elephant_skeleton.jpg"></a>African bush elephant skeleton
	<p>Elephants are the largest living terrestrial animals. African bush elephants are the largest species, with males typically being 3.20&#160;m (10.50&#160;ft) tall at the shoulder and 6,000&#160;kg (13,200&#160;lb) while females stand 2.60&#160;m (8.53&#160;ft) tall at the shoulder with a body mass of 3,000&#160;kg (6,600&#160;lb). Male Asian elephants are usually about 2.75&#160;m (9.02&#160;ft) tall at the shoulder and 4,000&#160;kg (8,800&#160;lb) whereas females are 2.40&#160;m (7.87&#160;ft) tall at the shoulder and 2,700&#160;kg (6,000&#160;lb). African forest elephants are the smallest species, usually being around 2.20&#160;m (7.22&#160;ft) tall at the shoulder and 2,000&#160;kg (4,400&#160;lb). Male African elephants are typically 23% taller than females, whereas male Asian elephants are only around 15% taller than females.<a href="#cite_note-Larramendi,_A._2015-46">&#91;46&#93;</a> The skeleton of the elephant is made up of 326–351 bones.<a href="#cite_note-Shoshani68-62">&#91;62&#93;</a> The vertebrae are connected by tight joints, which limit the backbone's flexibility. African elephants have 21 pairs of ribs, while Asian elephants have 19 or 20 pairs.<a href="#cite_note-63">&#91;63&#93;</a></p>
	<p>An elephant's skull is resilient enough to withstand the forces generated by the leverage of the tusks and head-to-head collisions. The back of the skull is flattened and spread out, creating arches that protect the brain in every direction.<a href="#cite_note-64">&#91;64&#93;</a> The skull contains air cavities (<a href="/wiki/Sinus_(anatomy)">sinuses</a>) that reduce the weight of the skull while maintaining overall strength. These cavities give the inside of the skull a <a href="/wiki/Honeycomb">honeycomb</a>-like appearance. The cranium is particularly large and provides enough room for the attachment of muscles to support the entire head. The lower jaw is solid and heavy.<a href="#cite_note-Shoshani68-62">&#91;62&#93;</a> Because of the size of the head, the neck is relatively short to provide better support.<a href="#cite_note-evolution-44">&#91;44&#93;</a> Lacking a <a href="/wiki/Lacrimal_apparatus">lacrimal apparatus</a>, the eye relies on the <a href="/wiki/Harderian_gland">harderian gland</a> to keep it moist. A durable <a href="/wiki/Nictitating_membrane">nictitating membrane</a> protects the eye globe. The animal's <a href="/wiki/Field_of_view">field of vision</a> is compromised by the location and limited mobility of the eyes.<a href="#cite_note-sense-65">&#91;65&#93;</a> Elephants are considered <a href="/wiki/Dichromacy">dichromats</a><a href="#cite_note-66">&#91;66&#93;</a> and they can see well in dim light but not in bright light.<a href="#cite_note-cognition-67">&#91;67&#93;</a> The core body temperature averages 35.9&#160;°C (96.6&#160;°F), similar to that of a human. Like all mammals, an elephant can raise or lower its temperature a few degrees from the average in response to extreme environmental conditions.<a href="#cite_note-Shoshani78-68">&#91;68&#93;</a></p>

	<a href="/wiki/File:Angry_elephant_ears.jpg"></a>  <a href="/wiki/File:Angry_elephant_ears.jpg"></a>African bush elephant with ears spread in a threat or attentive position; note the visible blood vessels
	<p>Elephant ears have thick bases with thin tips. The ear flaps, or <a href="/wiki/Pinna_(anatomy)">pinnae</a>, contain numerous blood vessels called <a href="/wiki/Capillary">capillaries</a>. Warm blood flows into the capillaries, helping to release excess body heat into the environment. This occurs when the pinnae are still, and the animal can enhance the effect by flapping them. Larger ear surfaces contain more capillaries, and more heat can be released. Of all the elephants, African bush elephants live in the hottest climates, and have the largest ear flaps.<a href="#cite_note-69">&#91;69&#93;</a> Elephants are capable of hearing at low frequencies and are most sensitive at 1 <a href="/wiki/Hertz">kHz</a> (in close proximity to the <a href="/wiki/Soprano">Soprano</a> <a href="/wiki/C_(musical_note)">C</a>).<a href="#cite_note-70">&#91;70&#93;</a></p>

	<h3>Trunk</h3>
	<p>The trunk, or <a href="/wiki/Proboscis">proboscis</a>, is a fusion of the nose and upper lip, although in early <a href="/wiki/Fetus">fetal</a> life, the upper lip and trunk are separated.<a href="#cite_note-evolution-44">&#91;44&#93;</a> The trunk is elongated and specialised to become the elephant's most important and versatile appendage. It contains up to 150,000 separate <a href="/wiki/Muscle_fascicle">muscle fascicles</a>, with no bone and little fat. These paired muscles consist of two major types: superficial (surface) and internal. The former are divided into <a href="/wiki/Dorsoventral">dorsals, ventrals</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Lateral_and_medial">laterals</a> while the latter are divided into <a href="/wiki/Transverse_plane">transverse</a> and <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/radiate">radiating</a> muscles. The muscles of the trunk connect to a bony opening in the skull. The <a href="/wiki/Nasal_septum">nasal septum</a> is composed of tiny muscle units that stretch horizontally between the nostrils. <a href="/wiki/Cartilage">Cartilage</a> divides the nostrils at the base.<a href="#cite_note-Shoshani74-71">&#91;71&#93;</a> As a <a href="/wiki/Muscular_hydrostat">muscular hydrostat</a>, the trunk moves by precisely coordinated muscle contractions. The muscles work both with and against each other. A unique proboscis nerve – formed by the <a href="/wiki/Maxillary_nerve">maxillary</a> and <a href="/wiki/Facial_nerve">facial nerves</a> – runs along both sides of the trunk.<a href="#cite_note-trunk-72">&#91;72&#93;</a></p>

	<p>Elephants usually have 26 teeth: the <a href="/wiki/Incisor">incisors</a>, known as the <a href="/wiki/Tusk">tusks</a>, 12 <a href="/wiki/Deciduous_teeth">deciduous</a> <a href="/wiki/Premolar">premolars</a>, and 12 <a href="/wiki/Molar_(tooth)">molars</a>. Unlike most mammals, which <a href="/wiki/Tooth_development">grow baby teeth</a> and then replace them with a single permanent set of adult teeth, elephants are <a href="/wiki/Polyphyodont">polyphyodonts</a> that have cycles of tooth rotation throughout their lives. The chewing teeth are replaced six times in a typical elephant's lifetime. Teeth are not replaced by new ones emerging from the jaws vertically as in most mammals. Instead, new teeth grow in at the back of the mouth and move forward to push out the old ones. The first chewing tooth on each side of the jaw falls out when the elephant is two to three years old. The second set of chewing teeth falls out at four to six years old. The third set falls out at 9–15 years of age, and set four lasts until 18–28 years of age. The fifth set of teeth falls out at the early 40s. The sixth (and usually final) set must last the elephant the rest of its life. Elephant teeth have loop-shaped dental ridges, which are thicker and more diamond-shaped in African elephants.<a href="#cite_note-Shoshani70-76">&#91;76&#93;</a></p>
	
	
	<h4>Tusks</h4>
	<a href="/wiki/File:2010-kabini-tusker-bark.jpg"></a>  <a href="/wiki/File:2010-kabini-tusker-bark.jpg"></a>Asian elephant eating tree bark, using its tusks to peel it off.
	<p>The tusks of an elephant are modified second incisors in the upper jaw. They replace deciduous <a href="/wiki/Milk_teeth">milk teeth</a> at 6–12 months of age and grow continuously at about 17&#160;cm (7&#160;in) a year. A newly developed tusk has a smooth <a href="/wiki/Tooth_enamel">enamel</a> cap that eventually wears off. The <a href="/wiki/Dentin">dentine</a> is known as <a href="/wiki/Ivory">ivory</a> and its <a href="/wiki/Cross_section_(geometry)">cross-section</a> consists of crisscrossing line patterns, known as "engine turning", which create diamond-shaped areas. As a piece of living tissue, a tusk is relatively soft; it is as hard as the mineral <a href="/wiki/Calcite">calcite</a>. Much of the tusk can be seen outside; the rest is in a socket in the skull. At least one-third of the tusk contains the <a href="/wiki/Pulp_(tooth)">pulp</a> and some have nerves stretching to the tip. Thus it would be difficult to remove it without harming the animal. When removed, ivory begins to dry up and crack if not kept cool and moist. Tusks serve multiple purposes. They are used for digging for water, salt, and roots; debarking or marking trees; and for moving trees and branches when clearing a path. When fighting, they are used to attack and defend, and to protect the trunk.<a href="#cite_note-Shoshani71-77">&#91;77&#93;</a></p>
	<p>Like humans, who are typically <a href="/wiki/Handedness">right- or left-handed</a>, elephants are usually right- or left-tusked. The dominant tusk, called the master tusk, is generally more worn down, as it is shorter with a rounder tip. For the African elephants, tusks are present in both males and females, and are around the same length in both sexes, reaching up to 3&#160;m (10&#160;ft),<a href="#cite_note-Shoshani71-77">&#91;77&#93;</a> but those of males tend to be thicker.<a href="#cite_note-78">&#91;78&#93;</a> In earlier times, elephant tusks weighing over 200 pounds (more than 90&#160;kg) were not uncommon, though it is rare today to see any over 100 pounds (45&#160;kg).<a href="#cite_note-79">&#91;79&#93;</a></p>
	<p>In the Asian species, only the males have large tusks. Female Asians have very small tusks, or none at all.<a href="#cite_note-Shoshani71-77">&#91;77&#93;</a> Tuskless males exist and are particularly common among Sri Lankan elephants.<a href="#cite_note-80">&#91;80&#93;</a> Asian males can have tusks as long as Africans', but they are usually slimmer and lighter; the largest recorded was 3.02&#160;m (10&#160;ft) long and weighed 39&#160;kg (86&#160;lb). Hunting for elephant ivory in Africa<a href="#cite_note-81">&#91;81&#93;</a> and Asia<a href="#cite_note-82">&#91;82&#93;</a> has led to <a href="/wiki/Natural_selection">natural selection</a> for shorter tusks<a href="#cite_note-83">&#91;83&#93;</a><a href="#cite_note-84">&#91;84&#93;</a> and tusklessness.<a href="#cite_note-85">&#91;85&#93;</a><a href="#cite_note-86">&#91;86&#93;</a></p>

	<p>An elephant's skin is generally very tough, at 2.5&#160;cm (1&#160;in) thick on the back and parts of the head. The skin around the mouth, <a href="/wiki/Anus">anus</a>, and inside of the ear is considerably thinner. Elephants typically have grey skin, but African elephants look brown or reddish after wallowing in coloured mud. Asian elephants have some patches of depigmentation, particularly on the forehead and ears and the areas around them. Calves have brownish or reddish hair, especially on the head and back. As elephants mature, their hair darkens and becomes sparser, but dense concentrations of hair and bristles remain on the end of the tail as well as the chin, <a href="/wiki/Sex_organ">genitals</a> and the areas around the eyes and ear openings. Normally the skin of an Asian elephant is covered with more hair than its African counterpart.<a href="#cite_note-Shoshani66-87">&#91;87&#93;</a></p>

	<p>An elephant uses mud as a sunscreen, protecting its skin from <a href="/wiki/Ultraviolet">ultraviolet</a> light. Although tough, an elephant's skin is very sensitive. Without regular <a href="/wiki/Mud_bath">mud baths</a> to protect it from burning, insect bites and moisture loss, an elephant's skin suffers serious damage. After bathing, the elephant will usually use its trunk to blow dust onto its body and this dries into a protective crust. Elephants have difficulty releasing heat through the skin because of their low <a href="/wiki/Surface-area-to-volume_ratio">surface-area-to-volume ratio</a>, which is many times smaller than that of a human. They have even been observed lifting up their legs, presumably in an effort to expose their soles to the air.<a href="#cite_note-Shoshani66-87">&#91;87&#93;</a></p>
	
	
	<h3>Legs, locomotion, and posture</h3>
	<a href="/wiki/File:Elephant_Walking_animated.gif"></a>  <a href="/wiki/File:Elephant_Walking_animated.gif"></a>An Asian elephant walking
	<p>To support the animal's weight, an elephant's limbs are positioned more vertically under the body than in most other mammals. The long bones of the limbs have <a href="/wiki/Cancellous_bone">cancellous bone</a> in place of <a href="/wiki/Medullary_cavity">medullary cavities</a>. This strengthens the bones while still allowing <a href="/wiki/Haematopoiesis">haematopoiesis</a>.<a href="#cite_note-Shoshani69-88">&#91;88&#93;</a> Both the front and hind limbs can support an elephant's weight, although 60% is borne by the front.<a href="#cite_note-cushion-89">&#91;89&#93;</a> Since the limb bones are placed on top of each other and under the body, an elephant can stand still for long periods of time without using much energy.

They use only two gaits when moving on land: the walk and a faster gait similar to running.<a href="#cite_note-Shoshani69-88">&#91;88&#93;</a> In walking, the legs act as pendulums, with the hips and shoulders rising and falling while the foot is planted on the ground. With no "aerial phase", the fast gait does not meet all the criteria of running, although the elephant uses its legs much like other running animals, with the hips and shoulders falling and then rising while the feet are on the ground.<a href="#cite_note-kinetics-92">&#91;92&#93;</a> Fast-moving elephants appear to 'run' with their front legs, but 'walk' with their hind legs and can reach a top speed of 25&#160;km/h (16&#160;mph).<a href="#cite_note-ReferenceA-93">&#91;93&#93;</a> At this speed, most other <a href="/wiki/Quadrupedalism">quadrupeds</a> are well into a gallop, even accounting for leg length.

	<p>The brain of an elephant weighs 4.5–5.5&#160;kg (10–12&#160;lb) compared to 1.6&#160;kg (4&#160;lb) for a human brain. While the elephant brain is larger overall, it is proportionally smaller. At birth, an elephant's brain already weighs 30–40% of its adult weight. The <a href="/wiki/Cerebrum">cerebrum</a> and <a href="/wiki/Cerebellum">cerebellum</a> are well developed, and the <a href="/wiki/Temporal_lobe">temporal lobes</a> are so large that they bulge out laterally.<a href="#cite_note-Shoshani78-68">&#91;68&#93;</a> The throat of an elephant appears to contain a pouch where it can store water for later use.<a href="#cite_note-evolution-44">&#91;44&#93;</a></p>
	<p>The heart of an elephant weighs 12–21&#160;kg (26–46&#160;lb). It has a double-pointed <a href="/wiki/Apex_of_the_heart">apex</a>, an unusual trait among mammals.<a href="#cite_note-Shoshani78-68">&#91;68&#93;</a> In addition, the <a href="/wiki/Ventricle_(heart)">ventricles</a> separate near the top of the heart, a trait they share with sirenians.<a href="#cite_note-Marshall_Cavendish-95">&#91;95&#93;</a> When standing, the elephant's heart beats approximately 30 times per minute. Unlike many other animals, the heart rate speeds up by 8 to 10 beats per minute when the elephant is lying down.<a href="#cite_note-96">&#91;96&#93;</a> The blood vessels in most of the body are wide and thick and can withstand high blood pressures.<a href="#cite_note-Marshall_Cavendish-95">&#91;95&#93;</a> The lungs are attached to the <a href="/wiki/Thoracic_diaphragm">diaphragm</a>, and breathing relies mainly on the diaphragm rather than the expansion of the ribcage.<a href="#cite_note-Shoshani78-68">&#91;68&#93;</a> <a href="/wiki/Connective_tissue">Connective tissue</a> exists in place of the <a href="/wiki/Pleural_cavity">pleural cavity</a>. This may allow the animal to deal with the pressure differences when its body is underwater and its trunk is breaking the surface for air,<a href="#cite_note-snorkel-53">&#91;53&#93;</a> although this explanation has been questioned.<a href="#cite_note-97">&#91;97&#93;</a> Another possible function for this adaptation is that it helps the animal suck up water through the trunk.<a href="#cite_note-snorkel-53">&#91;53&#93;</a> Elephants inhale mostly through the trunk, although some air goes through the mouth. They have a <a href="/wiki/Hindgut_fermentation">hindgut fermentation</a> system, and their large and small intestines together reach 35&#160;m (115&#160;ft) in length.

The female has a well-developed <a href="/wiki/Clitoris">clitoris</a> at up to 40&#160;cm (16&#160;in). The vulva is located between the hind legs instead of near the tail as in most mammals. Determining pregnancy status can be difficult due to the animal's large <a href="/wiki/Abdominal_cavity">abdominal cavity</a>. The female's <a href="/wiki/Mammary_gland">mammary glands</a> occupy the space between the front legs, which puts the suckling calf within reach of the female's trunk.<a href="#cite_note-Shoshani78-68">&#91;68&#93;</a> Elephants have a unique organ, the <a href="/wiki/Temporin">temporal gland</a>, located in both sides of the head.

	<p>Because of their large size, elephants have a huge impact on their environments and are considered <a href="/wiki/Keystone_species">keystone species</a>. Their habit of uprooting trees and undergrowth can transform savannah into grasslands; when they dig for water during drought, they create waterholes that can be used by other animals.

	<p>Female elephants spend their entire lives in tight-knit <a href="/wiki/Matrilineality">matrilineal</a> family groups, some of which are made up of more than ten members, including three pairs of mothers with offspring, and are led by the <a href="/wiki/Matriarchy">matriarch</a> which is often the eldest female.<a href="#cite_note-Sukumar175-116">&#91;116&#93;</a> She remains leader of the group until death<a href="#cite_note-African-112">&#91;112&#93;</a> or if she no longer has the energy for the role;<a href="#cite_note-Kingdon53-117">&#91;117&#93;</a> a study on zoo elephants showed that when the matriarch died, the levels of faecal <a href="/wiki/Corticosterone">corticosterone</a> ('stress hormone') dramatically increased in the surviving elephants.<a href="#cite_note-118">&#91;118&#93;</a> When her tenure is over, the matriarch's eldest daughter takes her place; this occurs even if her sister is present.<a href="#cite_note-African-112">&#91;112&#93;</a> One study found that younger matriarchs are more likely than older ones to under-react to severe danger.<a href="#cite_note-119">&#91;119&#93;</a></p>
	<p>The social circle of the female elephant does not necessarily end with the small family unit. In the case of elephants in <a href="/wiki/Amboseli_National_Park">Amboseli National Park</a>, Kenya, a female's life involves interaction with other families, clans, and subpopulations. Families may associate and bond with each other, forming what are known as bond groups. These are typically made of two family groups,<a href="#cite_note-Sukumar175-116">&#91;116&#93;</a> which may be closely related due to previously being part of the same family group which split after becoming too large for the available resources.<a href="#cite_note-120">&#91;120&#93;</a> During the dry season, elephant families may cluster together and form another level of social organisation known as the clan. Groups within these clans do not form strong bonds, but they defend their dry-season ranges against other clans. There are typically nine groups in a clan. The Amboseli elephant population is further divided into the "central" and "peripheral" subpopulations.<a href="#cite_note-Sukumar175-116">&#91;116&#93;</a></p>
	<p>Some elephant populations in India and Sri Lanka have similar basic social organisations. There appear to be cohesive family units and loose aggregations. They have been observed to have "nursing units" and "juvenile-care units". In southern India, elephant populations may contain family groups, bond groups and possibly clans. Family groups tend to be small, consisting of one or two adult females and their offspring. A group containing more than two adult females plus offspring is known as a "joint family". Malay elephant populations have even smaller family units, and do not have any social organisation higher than a family or bond group. Groups of African forest elephants typically consist of one adult female with one to three offspring. These groups appear to interact with each other, especially at forest clearings.<a href="#cite_note-Sukumar175-116">&#91;116&#93;</a></p>

	<p>The social life of the adult male is very different. As he matures, a male spends more time at the edge of his group and associates with outside males or even other families. At Amboseli, young males spend over 80% of their time away from their families when they are 14–15. When males permanently leave, they either live alone or with other males. The former is typical of bulls in dense forests. Asian males are usually solitary, but occasionally form groups of two or more individuals; the largest consisted of seven bulls. Larger bull groups consisting of over 10 members occur only among African bush elephants, the largest of which numbered up to 144 individuals.<a href="#cite_note-Sukumar179-121">&#91;121&#93;</a> These elephants can be quite sociable when not competing for dominance or mates, and will form long-term relationships.<a href="#cite_note-O&#39;Connell-Rodwell-122">&#91;122&#93;</a> A <a href="/wiki/Dominance_hierarchy">dominance hierarchy</a> exists among males, whether they range socially or solitarily. Dominance depends on the age, size and sexual condition,<a href="#cite_note-Sukumar179-121">&#91;121&#93;</a> and when in groups, males follow the lead of the dominant bull. Young bulls may seek out the company and leadership of older, more experienced males,<a href="#cite_note-O&#39;Connell-Rodwell-122">&#91;122&#93;</a> whose presence appears to control their aggression and prevent them from exhibiting "deviant" behaviour.<a href="#cite_note-123">&#91;123&#93;</a> Adult males and females come together for reproduction.

	<h3>Sexual behaviour</h3>
	
	<h4>Musth</h4>
	Main article: <a href="/wiki/Musth">Musth</a>
	<a href="/wiki/File:2005-tusker-musth-crop.jpg"></a>  <a href="/wiki/File:2005-tusker-musth-crop.jpg"></a>Bull in musth
	<p>Adult males enter a state of increased <a href="/wiki/Testosterone">testosterone</a> known as <a href="/wiki/Musth">musth</a>. In a population in southern India, males first enter musth at the age of 15, but it is not very intense until they are older than 25. At Amboseli, bulls under 24 do not go into musth, while half of those aged 25–35 and all those over 35 do. Young bulls appear to enter musth during the dry season (January–May), while older bulls go through it during the wet season (June–December). The main characteristic of a bull's musth is a fluid secreted from the <a href="/wiki/Temporin">temporal gland</a> that runs down the side of his face. He may urinate with his penis still in his <a href="/wiki/Penile_sheath">sheath</a>, which causes the urine to spray on his hind legs. Behaviours associated with musth include walking with the head held high and swinging, picking at the ground with the tusks, marking, rumbling and waving only one ear at a time. This can last from a day to four months.<a href="#cite_note-Sukumar100-124">&#91;124&#93;</a></p>
	<p>Males become extremely aggressive during musth. Size is the determining factor in <a href="/wiki/Agonistic_behaviour">agonistic</a> encounters when the individuals have the same condition. In contests between musth and non-musth individuals, musth bulls win the majority of the time, even when the non-musth bull is larger. A male may stop showing signs of musth when he encounters a musth male of higher rank. Those of equal rank tend to avoid each other. Agonistic encounters typically consist of threat displays, chases, and minor sparring with the tusks. Serious fights are rare.<a href="#cite_note-Sukumar100-124">&#91;124&#93;</a></p>

While most mammals have one surge of <a href="/wiki/Luteinizing_hormone">luteinizing hormone</a> during the follicular phase, elephants have two. The first (or anovulatory) surge, could signal to males that the female is in oestrus by changing her scent, but <a href="/wiki/Ovulation">ovulation</a> does not occur until the second (or ovulatory) surge.<a href="#cite_note-129">&#91;129&#93;</a> Fertility rates in cows decline around 45–50 years of age.<a href="#cite_note-Kingdon53-117">&#91;117&#93;</a></p>

	<p><a href="/wiki/Homosexual_behavior_in_animals#Elephants">Homosexual behaviour</a> is frequent in both sexes. As in heterosexual interactions, this involves mounting.

	<p><a href="/wiki/Gestation">Gestation</a> in elephants typically lasts around two years with interbirth intervals usually lasting four to five years. Births tend to take place during the wet season.<a href="#cite_note-139">&#91;139&#93;</a> Calves are born 85&#160;cm (33&#160;in) tall and weigh around 120&#160;kg (260&#160;lb).<a href="#cite_note-Shoshani106-133">&#91;133&#93;</a> Typically, only a single young is born, but twins sometimes occur.<a href="#cite_note-pregnancy-140">&#91;140&#93;</a><a href="#cite_note-141">&#91;141&#93;</a> The relatively long pregnancy is maintained by five <a href="/wiki/Corpus_luteum">corpus luteums</a> (as opposed to one in most mammals) and gives the foetus more time to develop, particularly the brain and trunk.<a href="#cite_note-pregnancy-140">&#91;140&#93;</a> As such, newborn elephants are <a href="/wiki/Precocial">precocial</a> and quickly stand and walk to follow their mother and family herd.<a href="#cite_note-Sukumar126-142">&#91;142&#93;</a> A new calf is usually the centre of attention for herd members. Adults and most of the other young will gather around the newborn, touching and caressing it with their trunks. For the first few days, the mother is intolerant of other herd members near her young. <a href="/wiki/Alloparenting">Alloparenting</a> – where a calf is cared for by someone other than its mother – takes place in some family groups. Allomothers are typically two to twelve years old.<a href="#cite_note-Shoshani106-133">&#91;133&#93;</a> When a predator is near, the family group gathers together with the calves in the centre.<a href="#cite_note-143">&#91;143&#93;</a></p>
	<p>For the first few days, the newborn is unsteady on its feet, and needs the support of its mother. It relies on touch, smell, and hearing, as its eyesight is poor. It has little precise control over its trunk, which wiggles around and may cause it to trip. By its second week of life, the calf can walk more firmly and has more control over its trunk. After its first month, a calf can pick up, hold, and put objects in its mouth, but cannot suck water through the trunk and must drink directly through the mouth. It is still dependent on its mother and keeps close to her.<a href="#cite_note-Sukumar126-142">&#91;142&#93;</a></p>
	<p>For its first three months, a calf relies entirely on milk from its mother for nutrition, after which it begins to forage for vegetation and can use its trunk to collect water. At the same time, improvements in lip and leg coordination occur. Calves continue to suckle at the same rate as before until their sixth month, after which they become more independent when feeding. By nine months, mouth, trunk and foot coordination is perfected. After a year, a calf's abilities to groom, drink, and feed itself are fully developed. It still needs its mother for nutrition and protection from predators for at least another year. Suckling bouts tend to last 2–4 min/hr for a calf younger than a year and it continues to suckle until it reaches three years of age or older. Suckling after two years may serve to maintain growth rate, body condition and reproductive ability.<a href="#cite_note-Sukumar126-142">&#91;142&#93;</a></p>
	<p>Play behaviour in calves differs between the sexes; females run or chase each other while males play-fight. The former are <a href="/wiki/Sexually_mature">sexually mature</a> by the age of nine years<a href="#cite_note-Shoshani106-133">&#91;133&#93;</a> while the latter become mature around 14–15 years.<a href="#cite_note-Sukumar179-121">&#91;121&#93;</a> Adulthood starts at about 18 years of age in both sexes.<a href="#cite_note-144">&#91;144&#93;</a><a href="#cite_note-145">&#91;145&#93;</a> Elephants have long lifespans, reaching 60–70 years of age.<a href="#cite_note-Shoshani70-76">&#91;76&#93;</a> <a href="/wiki/Lin_Wang">Lin Wang</a>, a captive male Asian elephant, lived for 86 years.<a href="#cite_note-146">&#91;146&#93;</a></p>
	
	
	<h3>Communication</h3>
	<a href="/wiki/File:Three_elephant%27s_curly_kisses.jpg"></a>  <a href="/wiki/File:Three_elephant%27s_curly_kisses.jpg"></a>Asian elephants greeting each other by inter-twining their trunks
	<p>Touching is an important form of communication among elephants. Individuals greet each other by stroking or wrapping their trunks; the latter also occurs during mild competition. Older elephants use trunk-slaps, kicks, and shoves to discipline younger ones. Individuals of any age and sex will touch each other's mouths, temporal glands, and genitals, particularly during meetings or when excited. This allows individuals to pick up chemical cues. Touching is especially important for mother–calf communication. When moving, elephant mothers will touch their calves with their trunks or feet when side-by-side or with their tails if the calf is behind them. If a calf wants to rest, it will press against its mother's front legs and when it wants to suckle, it will touch her breast or leg.<a href="#cite_note-147">&#91;147&#93;</a></p>
	<p>Visual displays mostly occur in agonistic situations. Elephants will try to appear more threatening by raising their heads and spreading their ears. They may add to the display by shaking their heads and snapping their ears, as well as throwing dust and vegetation. They are usually bluffing when performing these actions. Excited elephants may raise their trunks. Submissive ones will lower their heads and trunks, as well as flatten their ears against their necks, while those that accept a challenge will position their ears in a V shape.<a href="#cite_note-148">&#91;148&#93;</a></p>
	<p>Elephants produce several sounds, usually through the <a href="/wiki/Larynx">larynx</a>, though some may be <a href="/wiki/Vocal_resonation">modified</a> by the trunk.<a href="#cite_note-Shoshani120-149">&#91;149&#93;</a> Perhaps the most well known call is the trumpet which is made by blowing through the trunk. Trumpeting is made during excitement, distress or aggression.<a href="#cite_note-Estes-136">&#91;136&#93;</a><a href="#cite_note-Shoshani120-149">&#91;149&#93;</a> Fighting elephants may roar or squeal, and wounded ones may bellow.<a href="#cite_note-150">&#91;150&#93;</a> <a href="/wiki/Rumble_(noise)">Rumbles</a> are produced during mild arousal<a href="#cite_note-Sukumar145-151">&#91;151&#93;</a> and some appear to be <a href="/wiki/Infrasound">infrasonic</a>.<a href="#cite_note-Payne-152">&#91;152&#93;</a> Infrasonic calls are important, particularly for long-distance communication,<a href="#cite_note-Shoshani120-149">&#91;149&#93;</a> in both Asian and African elephants. For Asian elephants, these calls have a frequency of 14–24&#160;<a href="/wiki/Hertz">Hz</a>, with <a href="/wiki/Sound_pressure">sound pressure</a> levels of 85–90&#160;<a href="/wiki/Decibel">dB</a> and last 10–15 seconds.<a href="#cite_note-Payne-152">&#91;152&#93;</a> For African elephants, calls range from 15–35&#160;Hz with sound pressure levels as high as 117&#160;dB, allowing communication for many kilometres, with a possible maximum range of around 10&#160;km (6&#160;mi).<a href="#cite_note-Larom-153">&#91;153&#93;</a></p>

	<p>At Amboseli, several different infrasonic calls have been identified. A greeting rumble is emitted by members of a family group after having been separated for several hours. Contact calls are soft, <a href="/wiki/Modulation">unmodulated</a> sounds made by individuals that have been separated from their group and may be responded to with a "contact answer" call that starts out loud, but becomes softer. A "let's go" soft rumble is emitted by the matriarch to signal to the other herd members that it is time to move to another spot. Bulls in musth emit a distinctive, low-frequency pulsated rumble nicknamed the "motorcycle". Musth rumbles may be answered by the "female chorus", a low-frequency, modulated chorus produced by several cows. A loud postcopulatory call may be made by an oestrous cow after mating. When a cow has mated, her family may produce calls of excitement known as the "mating pandemonium".<a href="#cite_note-Sukumar145-151">&#91;151&#93;</a></p>
	<p>Elephants are known to <a href="/wiki/Seismic_communication">communicate with seismics</a>, vibrations produced by impacts on the earth's surface or acoustical waves that travel through it. They appear to rely on their leg and shoulder bones to transmit the signals to the middle ear. When detecting seismic signals, the animals lean forward and put more weight on their larger front feet; this is known as the "freezing behaviour". Elephants possess several adaptations suited for seismic communication. The cushion pads of the feet contain cartilaginous nodes and have similarities to the acoustic fat found in <a href="/wiki/Marine_mammal">marine mammals</a> like <a href="/wiki/Toothed_whale">toothed whales</a> and sirenians. A unique <a href="/wiki/Sphincter">sphincter</a>-like muscle around the <a href="/wiki/Ear_canal">ear canal</a> constricts the passageway, thereby dampening acoustic signals and allowing the animal to hear more seismic signals.<a href="#cite_note-seismic-154">&#91;154&#93;</a> Elephants appear to use seismics for a number of purposes. An individual running or mock charging can create seismic signals that can be heard at great distances.<a href="#cite_note-155">&#91;155&#93;</a> When detecting the seismics of an alarm call signalling danger from predators, elephants enter a defensive posture and family groups will pack together. Seismic waveforms produced by locomotion appear to travel distances of up to 32&#160;km (20&#160;mi) while those from vocalisations travel 16&#160;km (10&#160;mi).<a href="#cite_note-156">&#91;156&#93;</a></p>

By 1989, the population was estimated to be 609,000; with 277,000 in Central Africa, 110,000 in <a href="/wiki/East_Africa">eastern Africa</a>, 204,000 in <a href="/wiki/Southern_Africa">southern Africa</a>, and 19,000 in <a href="/wiki/West_Africa">western Africa</a>. About 214,000 elephants were estimated to live in the rainforests, fewer than had previously been thought. From 1977 to 1989, elephant populations declined by 74% in East Africa. After 1987, losses in elephant numbers accelerated, and savannah populations from <a href="/wiki/Cameroon">Cameroon</a> to <a href="/wiki/Somalia">Somalia</a> experienced a decline of 80%.

	<p>African elephants receive at least some legal protection in every country where they are found, but 70% of their range exists outside protected areas.

As of 2008, local numbers were controlled by contraception or <a href="/wiki/Species_translocation">translocation</a>. Large-scale <a href="/wiki/Culling">cullings</a> ceased in 1988, when Zimbabwe abandoned the practice.

Appendix II status (which allows restricted trade) was given to elephants in Botswana, Namibia, and Zimbabwe in 1997 and South Africa in 2000.

In extreme cases, elephants may be confined to small islands of forest among human-dominated landscapes.

	<p>Historically, elephants were considered formidable instruments of war. They were equipped with armour to protect their sides, and their tusks were given sharp points of iron or brass if they were large enough. War elephants were trained to grasp an enemy soldier and toss him to the person riding on them or to pin the soldier to the ground and impale him.<a href="#cite_note-Shoshani146-186">&#91;186&#93;</a></p>
	<p>One of the earliest references to war elephants is in the Indian epic <i><a href="/wiki/Mahabharata">Mahabharata</a></i> (written in the 4th century BC, but said to describe events between the 11th and 8th centuries BC). They were not used as much as horse-drawn chariots by either the <a href="/wiki/Pandava">Pandavas</a> or <a href="/wiki/Kaurava">Kauravas</a>. During the <a href="/wiki/Magadha_Kingdom">Magadha Kingdom</a> (which began in the 6th century BC), elephants began to achieve greater cultural importance than horses, and later Indian kingdoms used war elephants extensively; 3,000 of them were used in the <a href="/wiki/Nanda_Empire">Nandas</a> (5th and 4th centuries BC) army while 9,000 may have been used in the <a href="/wiki/Maurya_Empire">Mauryan army</a> (between the 4th and 2nd centuries BC). The <i><a href="/wiki/Arthashastra">Arthashastra</a></i> (written around 300 BC) advised the Mauryan government to reserve some forests for wild elephants for use in the army, and to execute anyone who killed them.<a href="#cite_note-187">&#91;187&#93;</a> From South Asia, the use of elephants in warfare spread west to <a href="/wiki/Iran">Persia</a><a href="#cite_note-Shoshani146-186">&#91;186&#93;</a> and east to Southeast Asia.<a href="#cite_note-SEA-188">&#91;188&#93;</a> The Persians used them during the <a href="/wiki/Achaemenid_Empire">Achaemenid Empire</a> (between the 6th and 4th centuries BC)<a href="#cite_note-Shoshani146-186">&#91;186&#93;</a> while Southeast Asian states first used war elephants possibly as early as the 5th century BC and continued to the 20th century.<a href="#cite_note-SEA-188">&#91;188&#93;</a></p>
	<p>In his 326 B.C. Indian campaign, <a href="/wiki/Alexander_the_Great">Alexander the Great</a> confronted elephants for the first time, and suffered heavy casualties. Among the reasons for the refusal of the rank-and-file Macedonian soldiers to continue the Indian conquest were rumors of even larger elephant armies in India.<a href="#cite_note-:0-189">&#91;189&#93;</a> Alexander trained his foot soldiers to injure the animals and cause them to panic during wars with both the Persians and Indians. <a href="/wiki/Ptolemy_I_Soter">Ptolemy</a>, who was one of Alexander's generals, used corps of Asian elephants during his reign as the ruler of Egypt (which began in 323 BC). His son and successor <a href="/wiki/Ptolemy_II_Philadelphus">Ptolemy II</a> (who began his rule in 285 BC) obtained his supply of elephants further south in <a href="/wiki/Nubia">Nubia</a>. From then on, war elephants were employed in the Mediterranean and North Africa throughout the <a href="/wiki/Classical_antiquity">classical period</a>. The Greek king <a href="/wiki/Pyrrhus_of_Epirus">Pyrrhus</a> used elephants in his attempted invasion of Rome in 280 BC. While they frightened the Roman horses, they were not decisive and Pyrrhus ultimately lost the battle. The <a href="/wiki/Carthage">Carthaginian</a> general <a href="/wiki/Hannibal">Hannibal</a> took elephants across the <a href="/wiki/Alps">Alps</a> during his war with the Romans and reached the <a href="/wiki/Po_Valley">Po Valley</a> in 217 BC with all of them alive, but they later succumbed to disease.<a href="#cite_note-Shoshani146-186">&#91;186&#93;</a></p>
	<p>Overall, elephants owed their initial successes to the element of surprise and to the fear that their great size invoked. With time, strategists devised counter-measures and war elephants turned into an expensive liability and were hardly ever used by Romans and <a href="/wiki/Parthian_Empire">Parthians</a>.<a href="#cite_note-:0-189">&#91;189&#93;</a></p>

The Romans in particular pitted them against humans and other animals in <a href="/wiki/Gladiator">gladiator</a> events. In the <a href="/wiki/Modern_history">modern era</a>, elephants have traditionally been a major part of <a href="/wiki/Zoo">zoos</a> and <a href="/wiki/Circus">circuses</a> around the world. In circuses, they are trained to perform tricks. The most famous circus elephant was probably <a href="/wiki/Jumbo">Jumbo</a> (1861 – 15 September 1885), who was a major attraction in the <a href="/wiki/Ringling_Bros._and_Barnum_%26_Bailey_Circus">Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus</a>.<a href="#cite_note-190">&#91;190&#93;</a> These animals do not reproduce well in captivity, due to the difficulty of handling musth bulls and limited understanding of female oestrous cycles. Asian elephants were always more common than their African counterparts in modern zoos and circuses. After CITES listed the Asian elephant under Appendix I in 1975, the number of African elephants in zoos increased in the 1980s, although the import of Asians continued. Subsequently, the US received many of its captive African elephants from Zimbabwe, which had an overabundance of the animals.<a href="#cite_note-Shoshani184-191">&#91;191&#93;</a> As of 2000, around 1,200 Asian and 700 African elephants were kept in zoos and circuses. The largest captive population is in North America, which has an estimated 370 Asian and 350 African elephants. About 380 Asians and 190 Africans are known to exist in Europe, and Japan has around 70 Asians and 67 Africans.<a href="#cite_note-Shoshani184-191">&#91;191&#93;</a></p>

	<p>Keeping elephants in zoos has met with some controversy. Proponents of zoos argue that they offer researchers easy access to the animals and provide money and expertise for preserving their natural habitats, as well as safekeeping for the species. Critics claim that the animals in zoos are under physical and mental stress.<a href="#cite_note-192">&#91;192&#93;</a> Elephants have been recorded displaying <a href="/wiki/Stereotypy_(non-human)">stereotypical behaviours</a> in the form of swaying back and forth, trunk swaying, or route tracing. This has been observed in 54% of individuals in UK zoos.<a href="#cite_note-193">&#91;193&#93;</a> Elephants in European zoos appear to have shorter lifespans than their wild counterparts at only 17 years, although other studies suggest that zoo elephants live as long those in the wild.<a href="#cite_note-194">&#91;194&#93;</a></p>
	<p>The use of elephants in circuses has also been controversial; the <a href="/wiki/Humane_Society_of_the_United_States">Humane Society of the United States</a> has accused circuses of mistreating and distressing their animals.<a href="#cite_note-195">&#91;195&#93;</a> In testimony to a US federal court in 2009, Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus CEO <a href="/wiki/Kenneth_Jeffrey_Feld">Kenneth Feld</a> acknowledged that circus elephants are struck behind their ears, under their chins and on their legs with metal-tipped prods, called <a href="/wiki/Elephant_goad">bull hooks</a> or ankus. Feld stated that these practices are necessary to protect circus workers and acknowledged that an elephant trainer was reprimanded for using an electric shock device, known as a hot shot or electric prod, on an elephant. Despite this, he denied that any of these practices harm elephants.<a href="#cite_note-196">&#91;196&#93;</a> Some trainers have tried to train elephants without the use of physical punishment. <a href="/wiki/Ralph_Helfer">Ralph Helfer</a> is known to have relied on gentleness and reward when training his animals, including elephants and lions.<a href="#cite_note-197">&#91;197&#93;</a> Ringling Bros. and Barnum and Bailey circus retired its touring elephants in May 2016.<a href="#cite_note-198">&#91;198&#93;</a></p>
	
	
	<h3>Attacks</h3>
	<p>Elephants can exhibit bouts of aggressive behaviour and engage in destructive actions against humans.<a href="#cite_note-huggler-199">&#91;199&#93;</a> In Africa, groups of adolescent elephants damaged homes in villages after cullings in the 1970s and 1980s. Because of the timing, these attacks have been interpreted as vindictive.<a href="#cite_note-teenage-200">&#91;200&#93;</a><a href="#cite_note-201">&#91;201&#93;</a> In parts of India, male elephants regularly enter villages at night, destroying homes and killing people. Elephants killed around 300 people between 2000 and 2004 in <a href="/wiki/Jharkhand">Jharkhand</a> while in <a href="/wiki/Assam">Assam</a>, 239 people were reportedly killed between 2001 and 2006.<a href="#cite_note-huggler-199">&#91;199&#93;</a>
	Local people have reported their belief that some elephants were drunk during their attacks, although officials have disputed this explanation.<a href="#cite_note-202">&#91;202&#93;</a><a href="#cite_note-203">&#91;203&#93;</a> Purportedly drunk elephants attacked an Indian village a second time in December 2002, killing six people, which led to the killing of about 200 elephants by locals.<a href="#cite_note-204">&#91;204&#93;</a></p>

	<p>Elephants have been represented in art since <a href="/wiki/Paleolithic">Paleolithic</a> times. Africa, in particular, contains many rock paintings and engravings of the animals, especially in the <a href="/wiki/Sahara">Sahara</a> and southern Africa.<a href="#cite_note-211">&#91;211&#93;</a> In Asia, the animals are depicted as <a href="/wiki/Motif_(visual_arts)">motifs</a> in <a href="/wiki/Jain">Jain</a>, <a href="/wiki/Hinduism">Hindu</a> and <a href="/wiki/Buddhism">Buddhist</a> shrines and temples.<a href="#cite_note-Shoshani158-212">&#91;212&#93;</a> Elephants were often difficult to portray by people with no first-hand experience with them.<a href="#cite_note-213">&#91;213&#93;</a> The <a href="/wiki/Ancient_Rome">ancient Romans</a>, who kept the animals in captivity, depicted anatomically accurate elephants on <a href="/wiki/Mosaic">mosaics</a> in <a href="/wiki/Tunisia">Tunisia</a> and Sicily. At the beginning of the <a href="/wiki/Middle_Ages">Middle Ages</a> when Europeans had little to no access to the animals, elephants were portrayed more like fantasy creatures. They were often depicted with horse- or bovine-like bodies with trumpet-like trunks and tusks like a boar; some were even given hooves. Elephants were commonly featured in motifs by the stonemasons of the <a href="/wiki/Gothic_architecture">Gothic</a> churches. As more elephants began to be sent to European kings as gifts during the 15th century, depictions of them became more accurate, including one made by <a href="/wiki/Leonardo_da_Vinci">Leonardo da Vinci</a>. Despite this, some Europeans continued to portray them in a more stylised fashion.<a href="#cite_note-214">&#91;214&#93;</a> <a href="/wiki/Max_Ernst">Max Ernst</a>'s 1921 <a href="/wiki/Surrealism">surrealist</a> painting, <i><a href="/wiki/The_Elephant_Celebes">The Elephant Celebes</a>,</i> depicts an elephant as a <a href="/wiki/Silo">silo</a> with a trunk-like hose protruding from it.<a href="#cite_note-215">&#91;215&#93;</a></p>
	<p>Elephants have been the subject of religious beliefs. The <a href="/wiki/Mbuti_people">Mbuti people</a> of central Africa believe that the souls of their dead ancestors resided in elephants.<a href="#cite_note-Shoshani158-212">&#91;212&#93;</a> Similar ideas existed among other African tribes, who believed that their chiefs would be <a href="/wiki/Reincarnation">reincarnated</a> as elephants. During the 10th century AD, the people of <a href="/wiki/Igbo-Ukwu">Igbo-Ukwu</a>, near the <a href="/wiki/Niger_Delta">Niger Delta</a>, buried their leaders with elephant tusks.<a href="#cite_note-216">&#91;216&#93;</a> The animals' religious importance is only <a href="/wiki/Totemism">totemic</a> in Africa<a href="#cite_note-217">&#91;217&#93;</a> but is much more significant in Asia. In Sumatra, elephants have been associated with lightning. Likewise in Hinduism, they are linked with thunderstorms as <a href="/wiki/Airavata">Airavata</a>, the father of all elephants, represents both lightning and rainbows.<a href="#cite_note-Shoshani158-212">&#91;212&#93;</a> One of the most important Hindu deities, the elephant-headed <a href="/wiki/Ganesha">Ganesha</a>, is ranked equal with the supreme gods <a href="/wiki/Shiva">Shiva</a>, <a href="/wiki/Vishnu">Vishnu</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Brahma">Brahma</a>.<a href="#cite_note-218">&#91;218&#93;</a> Ganesha is associated with writers and merchants and it is believed that he can give people success as well as grant them their desires.<a href="#cite_note-Shoshani158-212">&#91;212&#93;</a> In Buddhism, <a href="/wiki/Gautama_Buddha">Buddha</a> is said to have been a <a href="/wiki/White_elephant_(animal)">white elephant</a> reincarnated as a human.<a href="#cite_note-219">&#91;219&#93;</a> According to Buddhist mythology, Gautama Buddha's mother, Maya, dreamt that a white elephant enter her womb. The astrologers of the king's court interpreted this dream as the<a href="#cite_note-220">&#91;220&#93;</a> impending birth of a great person who would either become a 'Chakravartin' (conqueror of the world) or a great sage. In <a href="/wiki/Islam">Islamic</a> tradition, the year 570 when <a href="/wiki/Muhammad">Muhammad</a> was born is known as the <a href="/wiki/Year_of_the_Elephant">Year of the Elephant</a>.<a href="#cite_note-221">&#91;221&#93;</a> Elephants were thought to be religious themselves by the Romans, who believed that they worshipped the sun and stars.<a href="#cite_note-Shoshani158-212">&#91;212&#93;</a></p>
